# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for cleaning up and optimizing the CloudAge Education App project by removing unnecessary files, eliminating code duplication, and streamlining the project structure while maintaining all core functionality.

## Glossary

- **CloudAge_App**: The Streamlit-based education platform for teachers and students
- **Deployment_Scripts**: PowerShell and Bash scripts for AWS deployment
- **Task_Definitions**: ECS configuration files for container deployment
- **Policy_Files**: AWS IAM policy JSON files for service permissions
- **Temp_Files**: Temporary image files created during application runtime

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate duplicate configuration files, so that the project has a single source of truth for deployment settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing task definitions, THE CloudAge_App SHALL use only one ECS task definition file
2. THE CloudAge_App SHALL remove the duplicate task definition that has inconsistent CPU/memory settings
3. THE CloudAge_App SHALL consolidate environment variables into the primary task definition
4. THE CloudAge_App SHALL maintain all required container configuration settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused and redundant files, so that the project repository is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CloudAge_App SHALL remove temporary image files that are generated at runtime
2. THE CloudAge_App SHALL remove system-specific files like .DS_Store
3. THE CloudAge_App SHALL remove unused policy files that are not referenced in deployment scripts
4. THE CloudAge_App SHALL remove duplicate deployment configuration files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the code by removing unused imports and variables, so that the application runs more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning Python files, THE CloudAge_App SHALL remove unused import statements
2. THE CloudAge_App SHALL remove unused variables and functions
3. THE CloudAge_App SHALL consolidate repeated code patterns into reusable functions
4. THE CloudAge_App SHALL maintain all existing functionality after cleanup

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to standardize the UI components, so that all pages use consistent styling and structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering pages, THE CloudAge_App SHALL use the ui_template component for consistent styling
2. THE CloudAge_App SHALL remove duplicate Streamlit configuration code from individual pages
3. THE CloudAge_App SHALL apply consistent page setup across all application pages
4. THE CloudAge_App SHALL maintain the existing user interface appearance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove development and testing artifacts, so that the production deployment is clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CloudAge_App SHALL remove temporary files created during image generation
2. THE CloudAge_App SHALL remove build artifacts and logs from the repository
3. THE CloudAge_App SHALL ensure .dockerignore properly excludes development files
4. THE CloudAge_App SHALL maintain only production-ready files in the final structure
