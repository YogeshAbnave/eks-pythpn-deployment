# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for deploying the CloudAge Education App to AWS EKS using a modern CI/CD pipeline with GitHub, Docker, Amazon ECR, and Argo CD. The deployment will be automated, secure, and follow cloud-native best practices.

## Glossary

- **GitHub_Repository**: Version control system hosting the application source code
- **Docker_Image**: Containerized application package built from the Dockerfile
- **Amazon_ECR**: Elastic Container Registry for storing Docker images
- **AWS_EKS**: Elastic Kubernetes Service for running containerized applications
- **Argo_CD**: GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes
- **Kubernetes_Manifests**: YAML files defining application deployment configuration
- **CI_CD_Pipeline**: Automated workflow for building, testing, and deploying code
- **LoadBalancer_Service**: Kubernetes service exposing the application externally

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to set up a GitHub repository with proper structure, so that the code is version-controlled and ready for CI/CD automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL contain all application source code and configuration files
2. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL include a .gitignore file to exclude temporary and build artifacts
3. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL contain Kubernetes manifest files in a dedicated directory
4. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL include a README with deployment instructions
5. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL be initialized with proper branch protection rules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create an optimized Docker image, so that the application runs efficiently in Kubernetes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Docker_Image SHALL be built from the existing Dockerfile with multi-stage optimization
2. THE Docker_Image SHALL include all required Python dependencies from requirements.txt
3. THE Docker_Image SHALL expose port 80 for the Streamlit application
4. THE Docker_Image SHALL use environment variables for AWS configuration
5. THE Docker_Image SHALL be tagged with version numbers for tracking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to push Docker images to Amazon ECR, so that they are securely stored and accessible to EKS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating to ECR, THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL use AWS credentials securely
2. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL create an ECR repository if it does not exist
3. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL tag Docker images with commit SHA and version tags
4. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL push images to ECR after successful build
5. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL implement retry logic for network failures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the application to AWS EKS using Argo CD, so that deployments are automated and follow GitOps principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Kubernetes_Manifests SHALL define Deployment resources with proper resource limits
2. THE Kubernetes_Manifests SHALL define Service resources of type LoadBalancer
3. THE Kubernetes_Manifests SHALL include ConfigMap for application configuration
4. THE Kubernetes_Manifests SHALL include necessary IAM roles for AWS service access
5. THE Argo_CD SHALL automatically sync deployments when manifests change in GitHub
6. THE Argo_CD SHALL provide rollback capability for failed deployments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access the deployed application via a public URL, so that I can verify the deployment and share it with users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment completes, THE LoadBalancer_Service SHALL provision an external IP address
2. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL retrieve and display the application URL after deployment
3. THE LoadBalancer_Service SHALL route traffic to healthy application pods only
4. THE LoadBalancer_Service SHALL support HTTPS traffic with proper SSL configuration
5. THE Kubernetes_Manifests SHALL include health check probes for application monitoring

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to implement GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation, so that deployments happen automatically on code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL trigger on push to main branch
2. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL build Docker images automatically
3. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL push images to ECR after successful build
4. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL update Kubernetes manifests with new image tags
5. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL notify Argo CD to sync the deployment

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to implement secure credential management, so that AWS credentials and secrets are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL use GitHub Secrets for storing AWS credentials
2. THE Kubernetes_Manifests SHALL use Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data
3. THE AWS_EKS SHALL use IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) for pod authentication
4. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL scan Docker images for vulnerabilities before deployment
5. THE Kubernetes_Manifests SHALL implement network policies for pod security
